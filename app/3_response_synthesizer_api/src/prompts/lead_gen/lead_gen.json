      "additional_info": "This a small resume of Valere: Valere Labs consists of four development offices located in Croatia, Uruguay, Columbia, and India, with its headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. Valere has over 100 employees that include engineers, project managers, and designers, with domain expertise in mobile and web development, blockchain, web 3.0, machine learning, and the Metaverse      Guy’s career began in the sports tech space in the early days of mobile apps, initially setting out to build the “location based social network for pick-up sports.” The trials and tribulations he had undergone to solve this problem parlayed into continuous pivots, consequently evolving into consumer products Fitivity Apps and Elete. Elete, a computer vision sports application that worked with a physical Smart Ball, was a major innovation in sports training as it allowed artificial intelligence technology to become accessible for the consumer market. Fitivity Apps was the leading sports mobile application in the 2010’s used by millions of athletes worldwide. Guy exited Fitivity after it was acquired by Loyal Foundry.  Elete exited via acquisition as well. Guy has an extensive background in sports, including playing minor league professional basketball as a point guard. His experience developing his skills and playing on athletic teams inspired many of Valere’s processes and values."
