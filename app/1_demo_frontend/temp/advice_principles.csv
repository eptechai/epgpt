"There are three main attachment styles - secure, anxious, and avoidant. Knowing your style can help you understand your relationship patterns, and understanding your partners attachment style can help avoid fights and make you communicate in a way that solves for their attachment style. Anxious attachments worry about abandonment. They seek closeness but still feel insecure. Example: Mitch wanted to merge his life completely with new partners. He felt jealous and upset if girlfriends traveled without him and needily called & texted constantly to keep contact. Avoidants associate intimacy with losing autonomy so they pull away to maintain distance. Example: Hannah saw intimate gestures from her husband like unprompted affection or saying ""I love you"" as a demand, which made her emotionally withdraw and act coldly. Secure attachments enjoy intimacy and autonomy. They communicate needs and manage anxieties well. Example: Sam appreciated when his wife surprised him with fun date nights but didn't get upset if she needed alone time or a girls trip. He accepts affection but also welcomes space.",healthy communication
"Insecure attachments can evolve towards security by making self-awareness, empathy, and communication priorities in relationships. Set clear expectations around needs for closeness and space to avoid reactive breakup-makeup cycles.",healthy communication
"If your partner has an anxious attachment style, validate their feelings and provide words of affirmation about your commitment to them. This helps soothe their worries about abandonment. If you need space or alone time, avoid ambiguous communication and proactively let them know while reassuring your long-term dedication. Determine a limit to this, however, so that you don't feel doubted  (e.g., I will validate your feelings and provide words of affirmation about my commitment to you one time), and then encourage them to self-soothe. Set healthy boundaries around communication frequency/neediness but express care for their needs too. ",healthy communication
"If your partner has an anxious attachment style, don't take distancing personally. Give physical and emotional space without pulling away yourself long-term. Reassure them that their independence won't be restricted but their participation is still valued. Offer low-stakes affection and praise rather than pressuring intense intimacy. Encourage their interests outside the relationship. Don't overanalyze small withdrawal signs. Raise issues in unheated moments.

(3) Receiving Gifts - feeling valued by someone taking the effort to give you a tangible token (Ex: Bringing home flowers or chocolate just because you were thinking of them) (4) Quality Time - feeling bonded by someone's undivided presence and attention (Ex: Putting phones away to have an in-depth talk with your teen.) and (5) Physical Touch - feeling safe and connected by affectionate contact (Ex: Greeting your grandmother with a big hug when visiting her.).

"If someone tells you that they are feeling overwhelmed by how much you are texting them, reflect on your own communication and attachment style.

When people don't know what they are doing wrong, it is hard to improve their communication, actions, or responses to your needs.

However, if you feel uncomfortable telling people people in your inner circle about a lifestyle change, like not drinking, it might be time to consider if these people are the individuals that you want in your life. If you don't want to have to explain yourself to people less close to you, like colleagues, you can always order a soda water with lime at a work event, say that you are taking a medication that prevents you from drinking, or just say that you are driving yourself home.

"If someone says they were surprised that they didn't want to hook up with anyone else, that's just an immature backhanded way of telling you that he's interested in you. He could've phrased his thoughts in another way like ""I thought about you so much over the weekend."" This might just be him trying to be more casual, but use this as a data point to see if his overall emotional capacity. On it's own, this does not need to be a deal breaker.",
"You're the one wearing your engagement ring so the most important thing is for you to be happy with it, rather than follow a specific process. On one hand, it is nice to have it be a surprise but on the other hand, it is a lot of money and it is something you're going to wearing everyday. There is also a middle ground option where you make some sort of vision board of rings and styles that you gravitate toward, and let your partner take your brainstorm and make it into a reality of a ring that is informed by your taste but is still a surprise.",
"As long as you're using protection, there are no expectations, and you're happy with what you're doing, there is nothing wrong with sleeping with more than one person. You might be interested in learning more about ethical nonmonogomy, and how to balance the sometimes complicated logistics of being intimate with more than one person at a time. ",
Your dating app range should depend on how you feel about dating someone older and younger and how much of an age gap you feel comfortable with. There are no hard rules about this - but 2-5 years up and a 2-5 years down is a general rule of thumb. ,
"It is natural to think about what could be with someone else even if they have made it clear they aren't interested - but you need to give yourself closure so that you can move on to someone who is really interested in you. Sometimes, some kind of ritual can be helpful to help close one chapter - like having a ""funeral"" for the relationship or writing someone a letter after a breakup (and not sending it) to provide yourself some closure. ",
"if there is someone who you are extremely attracted to, but know isn't right for you - try to give yourself the 'ick. You can always imagine this person doing something you don't like and see if that visualization helps ""get over them"" more quickly. While great sexual chemistry is rare, it doesn't just happen with one person in the world. Now you know what kind of sexual connection you want with someone. Instead of wasting time with this person - imagine an individual who you have a great sexual connection with AND connects with you emotionally. The sooner you let go of this person the closer you are the whole package.",
Dating in a different city is an amazing way to jumpstart yourself if you're feeling bleh about dating since you have low expectations and its low stakes so you always are a brighter/ breezier version of yourself. it's also a fun way to explore a new city.,
"It might be helpful to consider unfollowing an ex's friends and family on a case by case. Like for example, if you love their sister and want to / plan to keep in touch, it is probably okay to keep following. Same with friends. But also if it's too painful/ a trigger for you then absolutely unfollow-or you can mute. They will understand.",
"If you are interested in someone and want to ask them out, go for it. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take as they say - the worst that happens is they decline and you are back where you started.",
"If you can't deal with a particular aspect of someone's appearance or personality that they can't later, then you can't deal with it - trust you intuition and move on. No need to waste anymore of your valuable time.",
"If you notice someone has changed their location on a dating app after you have gone out with them a few times, it is okay to feel hurt. You can either talk to him about it to see if he is open to being exclusive, or you can end it (and you do not need to tell him the specifics of why).",
"There are most likely thousands of potential partners around the world that we would be happy to have a fulfilling partnership with. There may be people that you find and totally connect with but logistical reasons may keep you apart. Ideally, you find someone who is ready to commit to you and the logistical issues are small enough that you can overcome whatever aspect of wrong ""timing"" may come up in your relationship.",
"It can be overwhelming to have romantic feelings for a new person after associating romantic energy with an ex partner for such a long time. It might be helpful to notice when you might be comparing this new person to the old person in whatever way. As much as possible, try to separate and view this new person separately from your past experiences. Enjoy getting to know this new individual - savor how fun and exciting it is to have a crush on someone!",
"Being dumped is a really thought situation to find yourself in. Instead of trying to focus on ""getting over them"" or avoiding all of the big emotions associated with the breakup, try to just take things in bite sized pieces. Give yourself encouragement and positive reinforcement for all of the great things that you are doing to take care of yourself during this trying time. You are going to get through it like you've gotten through hard things in the past. Be easy on yourself and know that the best is yet to come.",
"When guys say they are kinky on apps, actions tend to speak louder than words. If they were confident in whatever level of kink they like, it probably wouldn't have to be said so upfront and would naturally come up in conversation in person as you get to know each other better.",
"To avoid coming across as desperate, date with intention where you seek out people who have the qualities that you are truly interested in vs saying yes to anyone who is interested in you. You should know what your standards are, and not settle for anything less. Keep asking yourself if you like them versus if they like you.",
"If someone really wants to get in touch with you, and they try to dm you and they are blocked, they will find another way to reach you. You deserve someone who will go above and beyond to get in touch with you if they want to. ",
"People asking each other for their contact information in real life was really normal up until the smartphone era! Obviously, just because someone asks for your contact information does not mean you need to give it to them. It is completely within your right to ask to chat with them for awhile to see if you want to continue having contact with them. It takes a lot of confidence to go up to a stranger in public and be that bold - you get to decide what happens next in that situation.",
"You can't control if or when a person will come back into your life.  One thing in life that seems to remain true is that we can't control other people, we can only control ourselves and our reactions to what people do around us. That is up to them. You can control what you want your life to be with or without that person.",
"While it feels normal to look up someone on the internet, it takes away the mystery of meeting someone and finding out about them firsthand, and instead you will have judged them in advance. What they have posted online may not be the most accurate representation of themselves, so if you do choose to look them up, take the information you find with a grain of salt, and try to bring an open mind to your first in person interaction.",
You can never know why someone puts effort into possible connecting with you and then backpedals so suddenly.  There could be so many different reasons but the more important question is how are you going to move forward to find people that are willing to talk and move off of the apps and into the real world. The point of apps is to move from URL to IRL interactions and making that clear to people from the get go might help avoid this situation in the future.,
"If you are having fun and you don't care that the relationship is super casual, then keep enjoying your time together. If you aren't comfortable with someone dating other people and not having you be as much as a priority in their life as you want, then it might be time to have a conversation about it. You can express that you've had fun thus far but you don't see how this ""situationship"" is going to meet your needs at this time unless things move forward in z, y and z ways that you want. Focus on what you want and as much as possible, don't waste your time, it is so valuable and you want to use it wisely! ",
"If you want to be friends with an ex, ask yourself first why this is a priority. As long as there are no lingering feelings, and it's not a way to get back together - then it is ok to try. Be aware that they might not reciprocate the friendship - and it might be something that your romantic partners might not be super comfortable with. ",
"If someone makes it clear that they only want to see you casually and you are interested in seeing them casually, then you can make that clear and move forward with your existing plans. If not, you can thank the person for their honestly, and explain that you are looking for something more serious, and due to that disconnect, you won't be following through with your existing plans.",
"If your ex unfollowed you on instagram, it is a sign that they have moved on - there is no point trying to analyze why they have done this (personal preference, new partner). If it bothers you, the more important question to ask is why you still care, and if you are holding on to this ex in any way that might not be serving you.",
"It's hard to move on from someone if you are actively seeing or sleeping with them. The old saying, it is hard to get over someone when you are still under them, has stood the test of time for a reason. Distance and time are often really helpful ways to help move forward from someone that you want to cut ties with Spending time with yourself can be scary if you aren't used to it - start in small doses away from this person and potentially reconnecting with yourself and what you like to do on your own or with your friends.",
"Unless your friend is with a partner that is not a safe person for them to be with, physically or emotionally, it is typically not going to be helpful in anyway to express your distaste for their significant other. It can be difficult to see your loved one with a partner that you don't particularly like. however, it is important to trust your friend's judgement that this is what they want - we can never know exactly what is going on in a relationship. You don't have to pretend to be obsessed with their partner, but you do need to figure out how to accept and respect your friend's autonomy and decision to be with them.",
"If you are not sure about a new relationship, it is a balancing act i to know whether things might improve or if you aren't willing to put any more effort into it. No one can tell you one way or another what to do. You can ask yourself some questions that can help clarify what you might like about them such as whether you feel a connection emotionally, physically, intellectually or see a future with them. Once you get more clarity on these questions, it might become more clear about whether you want to move forward with the relationship or not.",
"Lovebombing is a concept that describes a type of behavior where a person very early in a relationship the other person is extremely attentive, flowery, and loving. They might talk a lot about the future and all the things they wanna do with you. They might use the term ""we: very early on. They might even say ""I love you"" very early and make the other person feel very safe. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, they drop you or massively scale back and it can be very upsetting and confusing. In terms of how to guard against it: It's easy to say ""I can't wait to take you to dinner here and do this with you"" but are they actually making plans? Are they actually following up? It's a fine line because you don't want to be too defensive but it is smart to keep your guard up in the first couple weeks of something new. Focus on how someone makes you feel and how they act towards you, not what they say.",
"If your partner is constantly lying about their past or other things, have a conversation to share about how these actions from your partner make YOU feel. I statements can be helpful to avoid blaming the other person and just to share openly about their behavior is making you feel. it is It can be challenging to have difficult conversations with your partner - especially about issues related to trust. ",
"If you go on a date and they don't text you but follow you on socials instead, it could be a sign that they are not that interested in you, or taking time to make their mind up if they want a second date. If someone is interested in you, typically they will make that clear by communicating it to you directly. Instead of worrying about if they like you, it is most likely more helpful to ask yourself questions about if you like them and if you want to follow up to find a time to be together in person again soon. ",
"If you made a decision to be intimate with someone you previous said you didn't want to be intimate with because it's what you wanted at the time, it is totally okay - we are all human. It is just important to get curious about why that happened and stay away from judgement and move on! Say ""I wanted to have sex and I enjoyed myself (hopefully) but this person doesn't serve a purpose in my life going forward"" and then truly just move on from it. Treat yourself the way you would treat a friend. You would probably laugh and say that you hope they had fun! It is normal to have people we just can't resist once in a while and that is okay. ",
It is tough to determine why there is a lack of energy from people who you are communicating with on dating apps. It sounds frustrating that you are not feeling like people are being reciprocal when you ask questions or try to liven up the conversation on the apps. It might be time to take things old school and see if you can meet people IRL instead of URL right now. Ask your friends if they know anyone who you might like or challenge yourself to give your number to a cute stranger at the coffee shop! ,
"It is a natural reaction to want someone to feel good about their sexual performance, and sometimes that happens by faking an orgasm. There is far too much pressure on ""finishing"" in sexual experiences verses just enjoying, playing, and being present with your partner or partners while you are being intimate. Orgasms are great - but they are not the ""end"" goal of having sex. The end goal of sex or any form of physical intimacy is to have a safe, consensual experience that brings you both pleasure. Sometimes that pleasure ends in an orgasm, and sometimes it doesn't. Communicating this to whoever you are having sex with can help take the pressure off and potentially allow you both to explore and have fun without stressing about something having to happen. ",
"If your partner acts in a way that upsets you, communicate your disappointment to your partner. The vulnerability of disclosing your disappointment/anger/annoyance or whatever emotion you are feeling is an opportunity for you and your partner to become closer as a couple, and allows you to stop telling yourself stories in your head that might make you jump to conclusions. ",
"If someone is texting you frequently but not making plans, you're a pen pal which is a waste of time. The point of communicating online is to make plans to spend time offline together. If people aren't making the effort to meet up in real life, it might be time to put your effort into people who will.",
"IRL>URL. Your in person interactions with someone should be considered much more important than how they present themselves online. If someone is posting stuff that is ""cringey"" or ""weird"" but you totally adore being in person with them, focus on that. Obviously, if someone is using their social media to spread hateful or discriminatory messages, that would be a more serious issue to consider. ",
"If you believe you are below the level of attractiveness than the people that you are attracted to, they might believe it too. The most important person to believe that you are beautiful/hot/cute/etc, is you! If you need to get a new haircut, recommit to your skincare routine, or get a few new cute outfits that you feel confident in, go for it. It is essential that you feel confident in how you look and also in who you are as a person. People aren't attracted to looks as much as they are attracted to confidence, energy, humor, intellect, etc. Do the work to be the best version of you. The funniest, sharpest most curious you. And every time you go on a date think - they're hot! Lucky me! But I also have a lot to offer.",
"If your intuition that someone is only interacting with you out of a sense of pity, trust yourself. It also is well within your rights to ask that person directly if they are communicating with you out of genuine interest or out of feeling sorry for you. If they can't answer directly, that is also a helpful answer to know that they are unable to communicate why they are continuing to chat.",
"If someone is not committing to you and you want them to, the ""why"" they are not wanting to be more committed this time around is probably not as important as considering ""what"" this makes you feel. If you feel like you've made your expectations super clear about what level of commitment you require from your partner at this time, then it might not be worth pursuing this relationship. It is important to have your needs met.",
"Ask your partner what they like to be called in bed if you aren't sure! Some people like their actual name or nick names, while other people love being called certain ""pet"" names. If you engage in roleplay, the name of what you want to be called or your partner wants to be called can shift and change. Open the dialogue of how to make intimate time better for both of you with regard to what you want to be called in bed and any other aspects of sex that might be unclear for the two of you right now.",
"Sometimes silence can be louder than actually saying something. If this person does not seem to care about you, then explaining why you don't want to be with them might not be useful. Moving on and bettering yourself and your life in the ways that you want seems like a more powerful response than anything you could text or say to them over the phone.",
"If someone's actions confuse you, it isn't helpful to try and mind read what it means. Just ask them! ",
"Being compared to your partner's ex in terms of sexual performance doesn't feel great as no one likes being compared in general, and definitely not around something as intimate as sex. While it is helpful for people to be clear and vocal about what they want in bed, they should not do it in a mean way (like ""you're not as good as them""). It is somewhat of a positive sign that they feel so comfortable with you as to give you concrete examples but it all depends on context and delivery. If they apologize, it probably was coming from a good place with potentially a poor delivery.",
"Sending nudes between two consenting adults is a flirty, sexy, and fun way to create intimacy between people. There is nothing ""cringe"" or ""wrong"" with sexting unless it is not consensual or done in an unsafe way (i.e. not using an encrypted messaging service) if that is important to you or your partner.",
"Instead of focusing on whether someone likes you after spending time together, focus on if you like them. You can ask yourself some questions that can help clarify if and what you might like about them such as whether you feel a connection emotionally, physically, intellectually or if you see a future with them. The most important things is if YOU are interested in getting to know them. If you do like them and you're wondering if they might feel the same way, the easiest way is to express your interest in potentially pursuing things romantically and see if they response. ",
"The point of dating apps is to move from URL to IRL. If you've exchanged a few messages with someone and you feel some kind of connection, it is probably time to suggest a specific time and place for you two to see if the online vibe matches the in person experience. Being direct and clear that you want to meet in person is a helpful way to stop the dating app pen pal life. ",
"There is nothing wrong with casual dating if you want to. it's a great way to explore what you like and don't like, and sometimes we don't have the time or emotional energy for a deep relationship.  Don't judge yourself - listen to your instincts and intuition and meet some interesting people that give you data for future more serious dating endeavors. ",
Do not focus on you or your current partner's past relationship history. People can get caught up in over analyzing their partner or their crushes history and then try to retroactively fit whatever mold they think they need to fit to be suitable for the other person but there is no need to compare your relationship to his past relationship. ,
"There is nothing ""wrong"" with not being involved with anyone or feeling like people aren't interested in you. If you want to be pursued, it might take a little effort on your part to put yourself out there. This could be as simple as asking your friends if they know anyone who might be interested in you romantically. Obviously, dating apps are a nice way to see who might be interested in getting to know you better. In life sometimes you have to create the opportunities for people to pursue you.",
"It is up to you if you want to give someone another chance after they have hurt you emotionally. Your well being is the most important part of this equation. If you feel like you have healed from whatever wound this person contributed to, and they have done the work to understand why they acted in a certain way that hurt you, and you both are committed to moving forward in a healthier way, there is no reason that you shouldn't be able to have a successful relationship the second time around. All of that might sound easy, but it takes a lot of work to make sure that you and this person are really ready to have a functional and committed relationship with each other.",
"There is no way to ""know"" why you are attracting people to you that are more interested in physical rather than emotional intimacy. It might be helpful to write down a list of what you DO and DON'T want in a partner and make those things clear to people that you are romantically pursuing. If you don't know what you want, it is difficult to get what you want. ",
"It can be difficult to untangle if you like someone or if you just like that they are giving you attention. You can ask yourself some questions that can help clarify what you might like about them like whether you feel a connection emotionally, physically, intellectually or just one or two of them or if you see a future with them.  the most important thing is whether YOU are interested in getting to know them more. ",
"The easiest way to start talking with someone is to start talking to them! If you know someone through a specific community (church, school, extracurricular activities, friend of a friend, etc), you probably already have something in common with them. The next time you see them at an event, or if you get their number from a mutual friend, ask them to do something 1:1 before or after the next time you might see them or just another time! It doesn't have to be a huge deal and most people are thrilled when someone shows interest in getting to know them on a more personal level.",
"It is normal to be confused about how to move a relationship forward when you meet someone a feel a connection but don't live in the same place. Proposing a time to see each other again in person seems like a helpful way to gauge how interested this other person is in continuing to explore the spark between you two. If they get excited or turned off by the idea of traveling to see each other and maybe meeting in the middle, you have great data to know if moving forward feels like the right thing to do or not.",
"Its okay to continue to see someone that you see not future with if two people are communicating well, have clear expectations from each other, and are enjoying the experience. Not all relationships have to be ""forever"" so there is no appropriate ""timeline"" of how long it should or shouldn't last. What matters most is that you both are clear about what you want and need even if it is clear that the relationship may not last in the long run.",
,
"Scarcity mindset is a mentality that is characterized by focusing on what you don't have and the idea that there is not enough positive opportunities/experiences/relationships/resources for everyone. This could look many different ways in terms of romantic relationships. Youl could settle for someone you aren't crazy about because you think there isn't someone else out there or thinking ""why not me"" when your friend gets a partner. One way to counter the scarcity mindset is to keep a gratitude journal.",
" It can be shocking to have something happen during intimate time that isn't expected - like getting your period. You can't help how you feel about a situation - all of your feelings and emotions are valid. Adults should be able to communicate about unexpected things coming up while hooking up. If whoever you are hooking up with isn't able to be kind and helpful during this type of situation, it might be worth considering if you want to see them again.",
"Here are some examples of how to send an ""anti ghost"" text: ""Thanks for a fun evening! I want to be upfront, while I enjoyed getting to know you a little bit I'm not interested in pursuing anything further. I do really appreciate you asking me out, more people should take that initiative. Thanks again and take care!


Thanks for the invite! Considering my current circumstances I wouldn't be comfortable moving forward. 


Thanks again for the second date- I appreciate your creative date ideas. I want to be upfront and while I've had fun getting to know you, I don't feel a connection. I really do appreciate you asking me out, more people should take that initiative. Thanks again and take care!


I had a great time last night, but didn't feel a connection. I hope we both find what we are looking for!


It was great meeting you and getting to know you a bit.  I don't think we are the right fit for anything beyond a friendship.  I hope we both find what we are looking for out there. """,
"It is a really normal response to be nervous about seeing an ex partner after a breakup. However, the reality is that you and your ex partner both still exist on planet earth. You might only see them this one time, or you might see them randomly throughout the rest of your life. There is no crystal ball to predict how it will feel to see them this time, or even years from now. It might be helpful to think about some coping strategies that you can do anywhere because you really never know when you might run into someone, like an ex partner, that you aren't thrilled to interact with again. Simple box breathing exercises can be learned on youtube and might help you regulate yourself in these situations. Whatever works for you to regulate yourself in stressful situations, practice it before you see your ex partner and know that you can always build up your toolkit of coping strategies for any type of stressful situation - ex partner related or otherwise.

"Even if you were in a really short relationship, it can have a big impact on you. Time is not the only marker of depth in a relationship. Focus on thinking about and processing what exactly is still lingering about the relationship. Writing your ex partner a letter, writing yourself a letter, free writing, making a playlist that represents the emotions you feel, and finding very personalized ways to think about this relationship and the mourning process can all be helpful to integrate what you want to learn and take with you in future relationships.",

"There could be a million reasons why they unmatched with you on a dating app. It is normal to feel rejected when someone unmatches with you on a dating app. However, it is important to remember that they have never met you in real life. Even if someone does meet you in real life and does not want to see you again, although it does seem painful in the moment, it is the kindest thing for someone to do to not waste anymore of you time if they don't think you two are a good match.

"Getting ghosted never feels good - we can't read anyone's mind about why they aren't texting us back but it makes sense to feel confused and even rejected - especially when you are hearing feedback that the person enjoyed spending time with you through second hand sources. There is always the possibility that they do like you and just have gotten busy and out of sorts and just forgot to reach back out to make plans. However, even in that best case scenario, it is up to you to decide how much effort you are willing to put in to figure out what is going on. It might just be easier to read this ghosting as a lack of real commitment, and move on to the next opportunity. Trust your gut and intuition if you should reach out or keep going forward to the next person.",
"If someone wants to keep things private, check in with yourself about what you like and don't like about their ask to keep things private. Privacy is not a good or bad thing - it is just a thing. You get to determine what it means to you. Sometimes people want to explore a connection privately before informing the larger friend group.",
"Cheating means different things to different people - for some people sexing crosses the line into cheating while for other people it might not. If your partner has cheated on you, you should time for yourself to think about what boundaries you and your partner have set with each other about what kinds of intimacy are acceptable with people outside of your relationship, and how breaking that makes you feel now and in the longer term. Trust is a huge part of relationships, so you need to see if you will be able to trust him again.",
" If you are the only single person in the friend group , and need people to go out with it might be time to find a secondary group of single friends who want to put themselves out there to meet people! If you have an acquaintance or something you don't know very well but who is single and likes to hit the town the way that you do, you could reach out to them. You could also hop on bumble bff and saying that you are looking for single people to go out with seems like a solid way to approach this issue. ",
"If you are okay with your partner being taller or shorter than you, then you are okay with it. Height really has nothing to do with how much you are attracted to and are interested in someone. If it works for you, it works for you, no need to overthink it. ",
"When someone says they like you but are nervous things are moving too fast, there might be a part of this person that feels insecure or scared about the pace of your relationship thus far. If you are okay with taking things slower, you can communicate that to your partner. If you would like the pace of the relationship to increase, that should also be communicated. If you want to take the relationship forward at different speeds, that is okay. You are both allowed to want what you want. You just have to consider if you are willing to meet them where they are at and vice versa.",
"No matter how old you are, you deserve to be fulfilled in a relationship even if it feels like the safe choice to stay due to the fear of being single. ""You are not too old and it's not too late"" is a helpful mantra because people get lost in the idea of sunk cost. You have so much to give and to enjoy.... Be brave.  You deserve to feel joy and fulfillment. Imagine how much harder it will be in 5 years. Imagine spending the next 5 years unhappy and THEN still having to go through the breakup.

"When your partner does something that makes you feel weird or uncomfortable, reflect on whether it is to do with your past history or whether it is because of your partner's behavior. For eg. if you have been cheated on in the past, your partner randomly messaging a girl might trigger those feelings which have more to do with your history than your current relationship; or if your partner has a history of cheating, this may feel like a warning sign about their behavior. The important thing is to figure out what is causing you to feel weird and either resolve it with yourself or talk to your partner so you can move past it. ",

"Sexual compatibility is not really something that you ""are"" or ""aren't"" with people. There is so much grey area in how much you might get along sexually with someone. Obviously, there are some people that you are just going to feel naturally more comfortable and aligned with in the bedroom. However, if you are with someone that you like and care about and feel safe with to have conversations about what you both like and want in sexual experiences, there is no reason that your sex life can't improve with someone.",
"The ""ick"" is sometimes hard to define and there is no easy answer why you get this. Scientifically, it seems most aligned with the concept of ""neuroception"" which is similar to the concept of ""perception."" Perception happens consciously while neuroception happens at a deeper level in our brains in our autonomic nervous system and sensory pathways. Not to be too nerdy, but basically, this is the part of our brains that helps us determine if people or situations seem safe or seem dangerous. This is a basic part of our brain hardwiring that is evolutionarily beneficial to helping keep us alive. Basically, if you get a gut reaction that someone is giving you the ""ick"" for whatever reason, trust that neuroception is trying to help keep you safe. ",
"We all bring developmental issues, like daddy issues, to our relationships whether we want to or not. Issues from our development, with parents or otherwise, will show up again and again in our relationship patterns if we do not take the proper steps to heal. The first step is recognizing what patterns or dysfunctions from our past are impacting our present. It sounds like you are in that first step which is fantastic. The next step is to think about what might help you process whatever past issue is coming up for your in your present relationships. Therapy, mutual aid support groups, and other forms of healing can help in this process. Find what works for you, but it is awesome that you recognize that you don't want this past issue to be coming up in unhealthy and maladaptive ways in your present.",
"The definition of closure is ""a feeling that an emotional or traumatic experience has been resolved."" Closure does not happen through another person, closure comes from within yourself. Journaling, writing a letter to that person, therapy, or other rituals that help foster emotional resolution for you are ways to seek closure. You bring yourself closure - no one else can do it for you.",
"There could be a million reasons why they unmatched with you on a dating app. It is normal to feel rejected when someone unmatches with you on a dating app. However, it is important to remember that they have never met you in real life. Even if someone does meet you in real life and does not want to see you again, although it does seem painful in the moment, it is the kindest thing for someone to do to not waste anymore of you time if they don't think you two are a good match. ",
"Breadcrumbing is a form of manipulation - whether the person doing it is conscious of that or not. The ""why"" someone breadcrumbs is less important than the ""how"" their actions are impacting you.Check in with yourself and see how that breadcrumbing is impacting you. You deserve to be with someone who doesn't use emotional manipulative to achieve intimacy through a relationship. Healthy intimacy doesn't start with manipulation - it starts with open, healthy, dialogues where you both feel safe to get to know each other.",
"When you are asked out by an acquaintance while not dating or not interested, you could say something along the lines of, ""I'm so flattered! I think you're amazing so I want to be upfront with you - I don't feel a romantic inclination and thus wouldn't want to mess up being pals! Again, respect and like you a lot and excited to keep getting to know each other as friends."" ",
"If you're nervous about the other person knowing you aren't drinking, you could always shoot them a text and let them know you'll be doing mocktails instead of cocktails at dinner. It is important to know that you don't owe anyone an explanation of what you decide to put in your body. If you are nervous just because it is nerve wracking to meet someone new, it is sometimes helpful to remember that nervousness is actually a part of being excited. Your nervousness is trying to tell you something - and once you figure out what that is you can move forward confidently as you embark on your 0 abv date.",
"Clear communication is one of the greatest tools we have to help us get what you want or to make crystal clear what we do not want. When someone asks to come over and ignores you request to meet on a formal date, there might be some miscommunication occurring between you two. Make it abundantly clear that you would like to meet in public for a date before you go to either of your respective homes. If you've already made that clear, then it is on them to respect that request or not. Either way, it gives you good data to decide if you want to keep pursuing this person or move along to the next.",
"If you have a gut feeling that your sex life with this person won't improve, listen to yourself and trust your instincts. On the flip side, most people don't have mind blowing sex the first time with any partner. Sex gets better over time as you get to know each other sexually and emotionally and become more in tune with each other.",
"You should not feel embarrassed about being ""behind"" your peers in any sexual way. There is a concept called ""social norming"" where in a society, we normalize certain things. For example, you may feel like it is normalized to kiss someone before you are sixteen years old. We tend to overestimate how much other people are doing things that we consider ""normal,"" which causes us to feel like we are somehow the only ones not kissing, having sex, drinking, or doing other activities. In reality, the research shows us that we are overestimating how much other people do things and that comparing ourselves to others often makes us feel unnecessarily bad about ourselves. I know that it might feel like everyone is kissing or hooking up or doing other things, but there is a pretty good chance you are overestimating and should just focus on what feels right for you and your timeline in terms of physical intimacy and any other choices you make.",
"The decision of whether or not to have a prenup is a really personal choice. One way to think about prenups that is a little different than how they are normally discussed is that you are trying to protect your partner from anything that you might do in the future financially. For example, if someone is hesitant to getting a prenup, it is normal that they might think you believe they are potentially going to be a financial liability later in life. However, you can note that things are unpredictable, and if you somehow incur a massive amount of debt, they won't be responsible for that if you both get a prenup. The future in unpredictable, and by getting a prenup, it can be a gesture of respect for the other person in the relationship, and vice versa. ",
"It is totally normal and common to fantasize about past sexual partners during your personal play time. As long as you feel comfortable and safe, fantasies are a healthy and fun way to keep your masturbation time exciting and personally fulfilling",
"People's level of intimacy on a date depends on whatever you and the other person want! There is no shame in getting it on during the first date, or for waiting until you tie the knot. It is all about what you and the person you are pursuing are comfortable with and are looking for. There is no right or wrong, but it is helpful to be clear with whoever you are going on a date with about what you expect in terms of physical intimacy to help avoid any awkward encounters after dinner when they lean in for a smooch! ",
"When you see your crush's online actions and don't particularly like what you see, it can cancel out your initial feelings as you now have more information about them, so can get to know them better and judge whether they meet your criteria for what you want in a partner. If you have some lingering feelings despite realizing this is someone you probably don't want to pursue romantically, it might be helpful to do some sort of ritual (write them a letter, throw their name on a piece of paper into a fire, etc) to symbolically help you move on to the next crush. ",
"If there is something super specific to your profile (pastor, children, amputee) that might be a deal-breaker for someone but is a huge part of your personality and life, it should definitely be included in your dating app profile. It is better that people weed you out on the apps directly if they're not not comfortable with this, rather than wasting time texting and meeting only to realize that they have biases. ",
"If the person going on a date with you is sober, but you have indicated on your profile that you are a social drinker, you can ask ""Do you mind if I order a drink?"" Then order one. If the person has an issue with it, you need to think if this is a characteristic that you would want in a future partner",
"If someone you have been seeing consistently says that they are seeing other people, you need to evaluate what you want from the situation. if you want to be exclusive, then you should bring it up with them. Can say something like ""I was thinking it might be nice if we were only seeing each other. What are your thoughts?"" If they say no, then you have your answer and can decide if you want to keep seeing them while they decide or if you would rather end things now.",
"If someone deleted the apps, and now is back on them and reaches out, that is a valid explanation. Some people get overwhelmed and delete the apps sometimes. The person is clearly indicating interest now and if you are interested in them, it is a great time to say yes. ",
"If someone has not taken the time and energy to fill out their dating app profile, it is not worth swiping on them. They clearly have not made this a priority and are not taking dating apps seriously. Lazy profiles are lazy daters.",
"Having a variety of pictures on your profile is pretty standard, so if you only have one or two, it’s not really too invasive for someone to ask why that is the case. You should consider adding more pics asap. Go for some high-quality shots that show off social, professional, and recreational activities you actually enjoy. ",
Using clear conversational strategies is a great way to be more open in a new relationship. Using an “I can’t tell” statement to let the other person know you need more context is a healthy habit to get into. ,
"There is a lot of stigma about age, so it can be hard to remember to take our own age-related questions on a case-by-case basis. You’re both adults and can make these choices for yourselves, so as long as you are not feeling the age difference as an issue, and they haven't brought it up, don't spend too much time on this. If you are dating someone considerably younger or older than you, be aware that you might have different priorities and different timelines. Have conversations about this earlier on, to avoid heartbreak later if the differences are too big to compromise or reconcile.",
"If you’re alarmed by how fast a relationship is moving, then it’s certainly appropriate to take a second and feel out what’s going on. Asking someone to be exclusive within less than a week of meeting is definitely a red flag. It’s totally fine for you to ask for more time to decide how you feel about someone. If you want to continue seeing them, you can say something like “I’m really enjoying this too, but I just want to go on a few more dates before a commitment like that.”",
"If someone tells you they’re not feeling the same attraction you are, that’s a pretty good sign you might not be quite right for each other, but it’s also a good chance to move on in a friendly and honest way. Just tell them you understand, and then take the opportunity to get right back out there and find someone amazing!",
"If you feel like you need to warn someone that you look significantly different from the likeness you’ve represented in your profile, that’s sure to lead to awkward outcomes almost every time. The solution is very easy - just update your pics. You are who you are at this current moment, not 15 pounds lighter or heavier, and your date should know who is going to show up.",
"If you’re back on the apps after a reasonable hiatus, it only makes sense to reach out to people you’re still thinking about. They’ll understand. Just say something like “hey I took a break from the apps but I’m back now. Feel like catching up?”",
"If you are getting too many texts from someone and feeling overwhelmed, let them know. People have different communication styles and preferences. If you have said that you aren;t a big texter and they still keep texting you, then it's grounds to end things.",
"When it comes to dating apps, your profile is all that other users have to go on, so if someone hasn’t put any effort into theirs, it’s a good sign they’re not too invested in dating at all. Even if some of those people might actually be great, it’s not your responsibility to do all the work it would take to find out.  ",
"After you’ve been with a partner for as long as a year, there probably shouldn’t be too much ambiguity about your long-term goals as a couple. If you haven’t had at least a few candid conversations about your feelings of compatibility, it’s time to let them know your thoughts and concerns about the future, then to listen to theirs.  ",
"When trying to get someone to ask you out, a single and clear nudge is all you need. Say something like “I’m enjoying our chat! Where should we go from here?” It sounds direct, but if they need more pushing than this, it’s a sign you two might be on different wavelengths and at least you’ll know right away. ",
"Staying on the apps even after sleeping together is not necessarily disrespectful unless you've agreed to exclusivity beforehand. If you feel disrespected by this behavior in someone you've been on dates with, considering exactly why and then talking with them about it seems fair, but there’s nothing too out of the ordinary here unless you each decided to consider yourselves a couple already.  ",
"Direct advice without being hurtful seems like the best way to help people with their relationship questions, although sometimes it can be hard to hear. You seem very receptive, and that will go a long way for you!",
"Reasons for sobriety can be all over the place, and they are often very personal, but they can also be no big deal, so it’s best not to make them a big deal. If someone you're dating doesn't choose to share their reason for not drinking with you, it’s never going to be your place to bring it up. If you’re concerned about making them uncomfortable by ordering a drink yourself, just ask them if they mind. It’s that simple. ",
"When someone you’ve dated in the past is only interacting with you by liking your posts but otherwise ghosting you, it is a good idea to at least unfollow them, and you can feel free to block them if that’s what you want. This situation is exactly what those features are for. ",
"If having kids is important to you, my advice is to skip anyone who’s actively stating they might not. It’s a huge decision, but a very common one, so you won't be narrowing your options much by sticking to people who do. There's no need to rely on someone changing when so many people are already on your level with this. ",
"Whether or not you reach out to an ex as a friend might depend on how long you two dated, but if you were hurt this much by the relationship ending, it doesn’t seem like a month is enough time for you to genuinely feel like “just friends."" Reaching out now could rehash a lot of the emotions you’re just starting to move on from, and it could be quite harmful. It's best to resist this urge for a little while longer, and if it still seems like the right call down the line, then maybe revisit the possibility then.",
"It’s natural to obsess over worst-case scenarios like never finding a lifelong partner, but in reality it's unlikely for that situation to happen. When you get upset about not finding the right person, try to remind yourself that the only thing getting in your way is your own anxiety about it. Just get out there and live the life you want! The world is full of people who would certainly be great matches. Also, remember not to maintain impossible standards. You might be thinking of the “right person” as the “perfect person,” but nobody is actually perfect. Give people a chance by getting to know them without the pressure of a lifelong search for love. ",
"If you’re concerned that someone’s overly focused on fidelity in their profile, that’s a valid thing to notice, but it’s not a serious red flag or any reason not to chat with them. It may mean they’ve had bad experiences with cheating in the past and are simply on their guard about it. You can keep it in mind but it’s likely no big deal. ",
"When you’re chatting with someone, if you feel like you wouldn’t normally be the one to ask this person out, but you get the feeling you should ask them anyway, there is really no reason not to go for it. They’re most likely on the same page, and if they’re not, then you’ll know sooner rather than later, which is always for the best.  ",
"Everyone gets older, and things change for us as we age, but there’s no reason dating can’t be equally fruitful and satisfying at any age. If you’re seeing a decline in matches, that’s no reason to get discouraged, because it’s not really a numbers game anyway. Try to really engage with the matches you do have rather than wishing for more of them. If having children is what you’re worried about, that’s quite understandable, but all you can do is put yourself out there and take advantage of every opportunity you can. ",
"If someone’s being vague about asking you out, like saying “wanna hang out” instead of a proper invitation to a date, you can simply follow up with your own question, such as “are you asking me to go on a date?” It’s best not to hesitate when gauging someone’s intentions. That way nobody’s time is wasted and you can start getting to know each other better that much faster. ",
"If someone hung up on you while in the middle of a phone date and then never followed up to explain, it is safe to assume that person isn’t worth your time and energy. Barring any highly unlikely circumstances, this is very disrespectful behavior. If you’re still curious or want closure, it would be reasonable for you to text them to ask what happened. ",
"If someone you’ve matched with is overly communicative over the app or text, and this is beginning to annoy you, asking them on a date might be a good way to get all sorts of topics like this out in the open sooner rather than later. They’re clearly interested, so they’ll likely say yes. ",
"If you had a chance meeting with someone you’re interested in, but you don’t live in the same place and arranged to go on a date in the future when you’re both able to, that’s a very exciting situation. There’s not too much to be worried about so long as you take the time in between to talk and get to know each other. That way, by the time you reconvene, you won’t feel like strangers. ",
"After you’ve gone on a date but before you set up another one, if you’re worried about the next date not happening, try to remember that you have a whole life outside of this relationship. Whether or not you wind up setting up another date with this person, you will go on other dates, so try to take it easy now and go with the flow. ",
"If you’re not looking for casual sexual relationships, it can be hard to clearly indicate this on your app profile for the unfortunate reason that some people are very pushy when it comes to online dating. Also, using words like “hookup” or “sexual” can actually guide unwanted types of people to your profile even if you use them in a different kind of context. Best to just be clear about your intentions when you actually start chatting with matches. That way there are fewer misunderstandings.",
"Scheduling dates one after another in  the same day is really nothing to be worried about as long as you plan accordingly and don’t rush through one just to get to the other. Dating is about meeting people and seeing who you mesh with, so there shouldn’t be any pressure to limit yourself to a particular number while you’re still out there shopping around. ",
"If you’re beating yourself up about how exactly to phrase something, like you’d prefer to be exclusive with a partner before sleeping with them, that’s usually just nerves getting in the way and the best course of action is to just say what you’re thinking directly. That’s what most people want out of their partners anyway. It avoids misunderstandings and it allows you to get on the same page much faster. ",
"Advice that suggests not ever exchanging numbers before the first date is overly restrictive and should be taken with a grain of salt. If you feel like you want to exchange numbers with someone because it would make things easier or it just seems like the right thing to do, you should feel free to do it. But “fact-checking” someone who you haven’t met yet is not necessary or worth it so long as you’re meeting them in a public place. Let them present themselves how they want to, and get to know them in a natural way, without snooping. ",
"If someone is representing themselves on the app by only a first initial, there’s probably some reason for them to be doing that. Maybe they do actually prefer to be called by the first letter of their name, or maybe they have an especially unique name and they don’t want to have people googling them all the time. Either way, if you’re concerned about it being a red flag, you can just ask them what they prefer to be called. ",
"If someone is sending you pictures that you didn't ask for and don't want to see, that's not something you should have to put up with. It's a highly inappropriate gesture for someone to send you pics of their body without your consent, and a good rule of thumb is to not ever text pictures of body parts to anyone who hasn’t already seen those specific body parts in person. People do this because they assume both of you are looking for that type of engagement on the apps, or they want to show off their body because they think that’s what you most care about. Either way, it’s certainly a red flag and you might consider moving on.",
"Try not to be too concerned about the possible significance of anyone’s past relationships until you’ve heard from them how they’re affected by it today. If you like a person, the fact that they’ve recently been in a serious relationship isn’t anything that should change your mind.  Everyone has some kind of personal history they’re trying to move forward from, and it’s better not to judge anyone until you’ve gotten to know them very well. ",
"If there’s something about your body that you feel it’s important for people to know about before they go on a date with you, and you also have made this clear in your photos, there isn’t a need to write that in your profile too. You can let the topic come up naturally in conversation, which allows you to discuss it on your own terms.  ",
"If someone asks why you’re single, there’s no reason to feel forced into divulging your personal history to them. It’s a potentially invasive and very forthright question, so a blunt answer is totally fine. You can say something like, “because I’m not seeing anyone right now,” and move the conversation along as fast as possible. ",
"If someone has unmatched you on the app but you two are maintaining a relationship IRL, this is not anything to worry about. You could ask them why it happened, but there are plenty of reasonable explanations and it’s far more important to focus on your time together and the conversations you are having over text. ",
"If someone is giving you an poor explanation for having missed a date, that’s a pretty bad sign that you shouldn’t ignore. Emergencies happen, mistakes get made, and it’s good to be forgiving, but “falling asleep” is not a reasonable excuse for standing someone up. You should take it seriously and may want to stop seeing this person. ",
"When visiting someone far away for a date, especially if you’ve never been to their house before, it’s best to set yourself up with some kind of backup lodging. Book a hotel room or Airbnb. That way, you have the option to stay at your date’s house or at the place you’ve arranged for yourself. It’s the safe thing to do, and it puts less pressure on the date, which is a win-win. ",
"If someone asked for your number so the two of you could plan a date, but then they never texted you, it’s unfortunately true that they might have disengaged and moved on. If you are still interested, you can ask them what’s going on, but unmatching them is a reasonable solution too. Try not to exchange numbers until you’ve set up a date so that both of you have something to stick to before getting off the app. ",
"If you’re chatting with someone who seems interested and you’ve both made it clear that you want children, but you’re worried about parenthood at your age, try to remember that the other person already knows your age and is interested anyway. There’s no need to make much of it unless it comes up naturally in conversation. ",
"If you only list your initial on your profile, and a potential date hasn’t asked for your name, that’s completely normal and not a red flag at all. It’s up to you to tell them what you’d like to be called, but it’s also possible this person will begin the date by asking your first name, which would also be completely appropriate. ",
"If someone you’re interested in is still friends with one of their past partners, more likely than not it’s a good sign they handle relationships congenially and reasonably. If they and their ex hang out all the time, that might raise some alarms that you could follow up on, but if they just have a casual friendly relationship, especially if there are children involved, then it’s just a normal part of life and nothing to worry about. ",
"If you’re debating leaving a comment vs simply liking someone’s photo or prompt on hinge, it’s always best to use the opportunity to say something too. Either leave a comment or respond to a prompt. The goal is to start a conversation and find out more about them, and simply liking a photo doesn’t accomplish that, or even begin to. Be bold!",
Most people will consider lying about your age on a dating profile as a very large breach of trust and probably end the relationship upon finding out. You want to represent yourself as you really are so matches are genuinely compatible. Outright lying about something like your age or where you are will not help to develop trustworthy relationships. ,
"Regardless of your gender or age, if you’re unsure of whether or not you want kids, you can simply indicate that on your profile and that’s all you need to do. No need to make it a big deal or one of the defining features of your profile. It’s a conversation people expect to have at some point in a relationship, anyway, so let further discussion come up naturally. ",
"If you’re searching for an opening line on Bumble, you can’t get that from anyone but yourself. Just like you want to accurately represent yourself in your online photos, it’s important that your words are your own, too. Look at the other person’s profile and see if there’s something there you’d want to talk about. Maybe a comment about a pet, or something they’re watching or reading, then just be creative and have fun!",
"If you had a great time on one of your first dates with someone, but you felt like you two didn’t mesh as well as you could have sexually, try to remember how often that happens the first time two people get together, and how often those relationships still flourish after they learn what each other are looking for. Take it as an opportunity to open up about what you like and what you want. Don’t let that one experience change you’re mind about a person you really like. ",
"If someone goes silent after a couple days of chatting, it’s a natural next step to reach out and check in with them. You can just say something  like, “Just checking back because I was really enjoying the conversation!” If they don’t get back to you, then you can move on, but it’s worth the effort since things come up and people get busy. ",
"The worst mistakes people make on first dates are the same for all genders and all types of people. They include talking about past relationships, not putting much effort into their appearance, acting awkward about paying for the date, sleeping together right away, generally not acting like they’re having a good time, sitting so as to stifle conversation, and only talking about themselves. All of these are unfortunate mistakes because they are easily avoided but very common nonetheless. ",
"If you had a great date and you’re considering cancelling others that you have planned in favor of seeing this person again, maybe wait a second and consider how you don’t want to make anybody else feel stood up or flaked on. Follow through on those dates while you plan your next one and enjoy them as low-pressure meetups since you have something good happening already. ",
"If you’ve been dating someone for a while and you’d like to ask them to be exclusive, that’s a conversation that should definitely happen in person with enough free time to discuss what you’re both looking for out of the relationship and wind up on common ground without ambiguity. You can say something like, “I’ve been having such a great time with you. I’ve been thinking it might be nice to focus on each other without the distractions of dating other people. What do you think about that?” ",
"If you’ve been dating someone for a little bit and they haven’t taken you on the kind of date that you’d prefer, like going out to dinner, but you otherwise like this person, it’s probably an issue of communication and not necessarily a red flag. Just tell them what your idea of a fun date would be, and they’ll probably welcome the fresh suggestion. ",
"If you’re concerned that someone who’s cheated in the past might be a bad choice in a partner now, the plain fact of them having cheated on someone at some point in their dating history is not enough to write them off. People change, and you might not have all the details of that past situation, so try to be patient and listen, and get the best picture you can of who this person is today before you make any permanent decisions. ",
"If you prefer a lasting, ongoing conversation over text as part of your relationships, and the person you’re seeing now doesn’t text that often, then just start initiating little conversations between dates and see how they respond. It’ll probably get things moving and steer the relationship towards the kind of communication you’re looking for. If they don’t respond often enough, then maybe they aren’t the kind of communicator you’re looking for in a partner. ",
"If you’re getting nervous about a first date you have coming up, then try to remember that the stakes of a first date are actually the lowest they are at any point in the possible relationship. Everyone gets nervous to some degree or another, but dates are nothing more complicated than just you and someone else meeting up to talk. Let it all happen naturally and don’t feel pressured to get into any tough conversations or speak too personally. Your goal can be simply to have a fun time.",
"If you’re “making” someone wait to go on a date with you, then whether that’s a good idea is a question of your motivation for doing so. If you’re just very busy and genuinely cannot meet until your schedule clears up, then that’s fine and you should be happy you found someone who’s interested and happy to wait a little bit to meet in person. But if you are making them wait simply to see how they respond, there is no need to manipulate the situation like that. You should just meet up as soon as you have time and both feel like going out. ",
"If you’d planned to go on a date with someone, and then they send you texts and photos that make you uncomfortable, it’s absolutely fine to cancel the date. You can provide them with an explanation if you want to, like “I didn’t ask for that photo and this kind of conversation isn’t what I’m looking for. I’m cancelling the date. All the best.” You’re never on the hook to follow through on plans you don’t feel comfortable with. ",
"If this upcoming date is some kind of test for you, like maybe the last date went poorly and this is the last chance you’re giving the relationship, that’s a lot of pressure to put on this one event in the relationship. Instead of basing a decision like ending a relationship on one date, it’s better to think things through and feel out what you’d really like to do in the long term.",
"If you don’t feel like you’re getting the results you want out of the dating apps, it’s fine to take a break from them, but remember that the apps are a supplement to meeting people in real life, not a replacement. There’s nothing about being on the app that prevents you from dating in other ways too. There may also be things you can change about how you use these apps that would make them more effective. Overall, it’s going to be a combination of factors that influences how many dates you go on and what you get out of them. ",
"If you’re trying to end a relationship but having trouble figuring out how to do it, the answer is usually to simply go ahead and do it the way that comes naturally. Don’t blow it out of proportion, but also dedicate some time and energy to the conversation. Ending relationships is never easy, but it’s about getting over our worries and staying strong. Know that you have people out there to call on. ",
"When you’ve decided to narrow down your possible partners to just one person, it’s important to let the others know you’re not interested in dating anymore and it’s fine to be honest with them about why. Just politely tell them how you had a great time with them but you’re getting more serious with someone else and aren’t really dating anymore. ",
"If you’re in the stages of dating someone and you’ve left the conversation with them setting up a date, it’s absolutely up to that person to follow through on those plans. If you never hear from them, you can reach out, but keep in mind that this person has begun the relationship on the wrong foot, so you might consider moving on and getting back out there with other people.

"If someone you’re interested in expresses that they’re unsure about kids, and you know for certain that you do not want children, then the only thing you can do is make sure you know each other’s honest feelings on the subject. After that, the decisions are your own. If they move forward with the relationship, you can take that as a sign they are happy to not plan for children as long as you’re together. ",
"When your date isn’t moving forward with something romantic that you’d hoped to experience, like kissing, but you’re otherwise quite happy with the relationship, simply tell them what you’re interested in. You can say something like “I’d really like to kiss you, now. Would you like that, too?” After a few dates it’s more than appropriate to be honest about things like that. ",
"When you’re worried you’ve scheduled too many dates in too short a time, it’s fair to consider what you really want to do, like whether you have the energy or if it will make you too busy for work, but don’t worry about anyone else. Just do what feels right and have fun while you’re at it. If you have the resources and the energy, go on as many dates as you want!",
"If someone has ghosted you over text, it’s tempting to think something is wrong with your channels of communication, like their phone is broken or something’s wrong with your messaging, but in reality that’s very unlikely. Much more often, someone has made the choice not to respond for one reason or another. That said, there are reasons that could happen which might not involve you, such as getting suddenly busy and not having the bandwidth for dating, so it might be worth checking in just to see. ",
"If you’re feeling guilty after ending a relationship, that’s natural, but breaking up in an honest, respectful fashion is actually a very kind thing to do. Avoiding these decisions or convincing yourself to stay despite wanting to leave would only cause your ex-partner more harm when you finally did break it off. If you were confident that ending the relationship was what you wanted, then this was absolutely the right call. ",
"In this context, “breadcrumbing” is when someone gives out just enough attention to keep someone feeling like they are building a relationship, when in reality the person may not actually be as invested as they seem. If someone is “breadcrumbing” you, it’s a good idea to have a conversation about what you both want out of the relationship before becoming too invested yourself. ",
"If you’re trying to convey to someone you’re dating that you don’t want to sleep with them until you’ve committed to exclusivity, there’s no reason to dance around that or risk it coming across like a joke. It’s extremely important for you both to be on the same page about it, so just be clear and direct, and if there’s any pushback, you know this isn’t a good match. Simple as that. ",
"When you’re in a situation where someone you’re seeing isn’t giving you the attention you need and making you feel bad, there’s no way around it but to end the situation. It can be very hard, but take comfort in the fact that it happens to everyone. Try to commit to calling it off, even if it feels like sometimes things are really good. It’s not worth it in the long run. You want to be spending your time with someone who lifts you up, and there are plenty of people out there who surely will!",
"If you’ve concluded that a certain type of person, like all men, or all women, or all so and so, always has a certain type of problem, then you are over-generalizing and may even be seeking out that type of person by accident. The world is full of amazing people of all stripes. Ff you allow yourself to be open to them, you’re bound to find someone who’s right for you. ",
"If you’re wondering what is the equivalent of cringey masculine profiles for their more feminine counterparts, some examples might include: Overly edited photos, various ways of tacitly hiding your identity or appearance, appearing so attached to your dog that it’s a little much, odd expressions in photos, pictures of children if you don’t have any children, and too many specifics about what you’ll accept as a partner. This is a very subjective comparison, but these examples might represent some common assumptions that people make. [Don’t know if this one should actually just flag a warning, like “it’s best not to make comparisons and generalizations based on gender.” But I went ahead and summarized the answer column just in case.]",
"If you’re getting feedback from people you trust that your life has become too much about work, don’t feel guilty about your independence or your financial success, but at the same time try not to let those topics leak into your romantic pursuits too much. Try not to focus on your job, and certainly not on money, until you’ve really allowed someone to get to know you for who you are outside of those things. That way you’ll be basing your relationships on a lasting connection that isn’t tied to tricky subjects like money. ",
"If you’re worried about playing into a certain stereotype by focusing too much on something like bodybuilding in your profile, but at the same time that is a very important part of your life, it’s okay to downplay it a little and leave it to a quick mention online. You can let it come up naturally in conversation, allowing potential dates to know you as a person before they pigeonhole you into the kind of person who does such and such a thing. ",
"If you’re open to dating someone with children but not interested in having children yourself, you fall into a category that’s difficult to convey quickly on the apps. That’s okay, though, just click “don’t want” or “open to children,” and then if you reach out to people who clearly already have kids, they should understand pretty quickly. It’s probably best to have that conversation earlier on with potential dates, but it shouldn’t be too complicated and I’m sure many will find it welcome attitude. ",
"If you’re considering posting a picture of you with a child (with an emoji over their face) who is not your own, consider that very few people browsing the apps take the time to read captions, and they will likely assume that you have children. Beyond this, it’s not necessarily respectful to cover people’s faces with emojis as a workaround to lacking their consent. Opt for a picture that’s more appropriate for a dating app. ",
"When browsing the apps, if you explicitly want children, than you have the unique opportunity to filter your potential dates by those who share that desire. You should take advantage of that rather than engaging with people who are “not sure.”  ",
"When someone hasn’t asked you out on a second date, and you’re not sure of the reason, it’s best to simply jump in and ask them on a second date yourself. Even if you wouldn’t usually be the one to do that, or if you’re afraid they might say no, better to take care of that now so you know what the future looks like with this person. ",
"If you’ve met someone in a virtual setting who doesn’t live anywhere near you, video chats are going to be a part of that relationship if you choose to pursue it. You might as well get that started sooner rather than later! Arrange a time that works for both of you and say something like “want to hang on FT sometime soon? Would tonight work?” ",
"When you’re already exclusive with someone but you’re not exactly sure what your specific roles are, the best way to clear that up is to introduce it into a conversation without putting too much pressure on it. Just say something like “I don’t know what to call you now to my friends? What do you call me?” Most of the time you’ll actually be on the same page about it. ",
"If somebody is acting like they’re going to ask you out, but they never do, simply prompt them to commit by suggesting a specific time and place. If they’ve been dancing around it anyway, they’ll almost certainly be excited about it, and on the off chance they aren’t, then at least you’ve discovered their intentions. ",
"If you’re looking for a secret shortcut to understanding someone’s emotional profile, unfortunately there isn’t one. You just have to get to know them, and that takes time, but that’s what building a relationship is all about. There wouldn’t be any fun in dating if people couldn’t sometimes surprise you, so just try to stay open-minded and if you like someone enough, spend the time with them to see who they really are. ",
"In trying to figure out if someone’s losing interest or just doesn’t text all that much, the most important thing to look for is a change in their pattern of communication. If they’ve always been a very frequent texter but that suddenly changes, it might be worth asking them about. But if they just aren’t a big texter and they never have been, it’s just who they are, and it doesn’t mean anything about their interest in you. ",
"If someone asked you out but hasn’t said a lot else via text, that’s pretty normal behavior and almost definitely nothing to worry about. They are probably excited to meet you in person and are saving the conversation until then, or maybe they are just busy and don’t have a lot of time to be on the phone. Regardless of why, there’s no harm in just waiting until the first date to gauge their interest. Before that, you’re just guessing. ",
"If you had a phone date that went well, don’t hesitate to follow up and suggest meeting in person. That’s probably what you were both thinking the phone date would lead to, so go ahead and make it happen. You can say something like, “loved our talk last night! Want to meet this weekend for dinner?” ",
"When someone hits you with news that is out of their control, like needing surgery, but also changes how you envision your future with that person, take a moment to see things from their perspective. Try to show empathy and compassion. Dating is about spending time with people and developing relationships. None of that changes when someone’s life circumstances get more complicated. If you really like this person, maybe try to stick it out with them one way or the other.",
"When someone asks to start with a phone call or facetime before committing to a date, you can either agree if you’re okay with that, or you can suggest just going out in person to a specific place at a specific time. That’s really the best way to get to know someone, and you can tell this person that’s just how you feel. On the other hand, if you do start with a video call, make sure to schedule with the same specificity so you each have something concrete to commit to. ",
"If you can’t decide whether to put your real name on a dating profile, then you might be feeling worried about online privacy. Most of the time, it’s best to use your real first name so that you can start off any possible relationships with a tone of honesty, but if you have other reasons to be concerned anonymity, or if you have a first name that might be enough for someone to look you up just with that and your general location, you might use just an initial instead. There are many valid reasons not to use your real name, but most of the time it's the best thing to do. ",
"If someone you’re interested in seeing has asked you to dinner, but you’d rather take things one step slower, or you’re just bored by dinner dates, then simply tell them so without being too serious about it or blowing it out of proportion. Just say something along the lines of “How ‘bout coffee first? Sunday afternoon?”",
"If you’re considering telling someone that you love them, keep in mind how that means different things to different people, but for many it is quite a serious statement with a lot of implied commitment. If you’re doubting very much at all whether you should say it, then giving it a little more time just to be sure is probably the best call. ",
"If you find yourself wondering how many texts is appropriate to receive from a partner after dating for a good amount of time, then you are probably receiving what you consider to be either too many or not enough texts. There’s no strict rule about it but being on the same page is important. Try bringing up how you feel about communicating and discussing it candidly. It's very likely they'll be happy to change their texting habits to make you happy.   ",
"If someone you just met is texting you a lot while you’re at work and that’s not something you’re comfortable doing, but you still want to talk to them, just tell them you don’t have the kind of job where that’s really possible but you’re really looking forward to talking after. They’ll understand, and if that’s a big deal to them, then you’ll know the two of you are probably not compatible, at least not right now. ",
"Debating when to send a follow-up text after a date that went well is not something you should be pulling your hair out over. A lot of people get hung up on this, but if you’re interested in this person, there’s no point in setting an arbitrary schedule about when or when not to tell them. When you do tell them, they’ll either reflect your excitement or they will have an opportunity to express different feelings. Either way, there’s no point in delaying the conversation. ",
"When going through dating app profiles, people are looking for purpose, not perfect.  You need to communicate
effectively about your purpose and passions. People want to understand what motivates you, and what you're working to accomplish, before they'll ""swipe right"" so make sure your profile accurately represents this.",
"Even if you feel weird about online dating on the apps, everyone is doing it so you need to as well. ",
It is more than likely that your date will look you up online before both of you meet (and you probably will too). Make sure to put your best foot forward and maintain an online presence that you are proud of. Keep it clean. ,
It is ideal to remove photos of your ex from your social profile. You don't want that to hold you back from meeting new people or prevent you from looking single. ,

"If you just exited a long-term relationship and are back in the dating scene, invest in some new outfits that make you both feel and look good. ",
"Refrain from taking about your past relationships especially on the first date. Stay away from statements such as ""It's been a while since I've been single"". You don't want to send them the wrong message or make them feel like you are using them as a rebound. ",
"You need to feel confident in yourself and be aware of what you are looking for. You don't want to sound confused in front of your date about your dating goals - that wouldn't reflect so well. If you are unsure about a person let them know that you are ""open to seeing where this goes."" It shows that you are interested in getting to know them to see if there is potential of a future between both of you. People are looking for someone that's single, thriving, and is interested in them - be that person.  ",
"If you just got out of a long-term relationship, you want to feel confident in yourself before going back out onto the dating scene. These could mean a variety of things: upgrading your wardrobe, pursuing a new interest, etc. ",
"When thinking about how to introduce yourself on an app or in real life, take the time to self reflect on where you are in life and where you see yourself going. It's important for you to be confident in the story you tell other people about yourself. If you are not there yet, then take the time to figure out your narrative. ",
"If you are texting someone you just started seeing and are nervous about how long you should wait to send a text, you're focusing your attention on the wrong thing. You want to make sure you are enjoying the conversation, so it doesn't matter if you text 5 minutes later or 5 hours later. You should do what feels natural. ",
"When texting someone you are seeing, you want to focus on having a great conversation with them and see if that reflects in your in-person dates. You want to find a balance between texting and focusing on your personal life. You do not want to be glued to your phone waiting for a text, but you also want to engage in texting such that both of you are genuinely excited to receive a message from one another. ",
"Not everyone is a comedian and that is okay. You want to focus on enjoying the conversation and genuinely feel excited to continue the conversation with the person you are texting. If you have good humor, you are in great shape. ",
If you are unsure how to continue a conversation you can share a light compliment or how you feel about something (i.e. ideally something positive about your work or a plan you are excited about). The goal is determine whether or not you are enjoying the conversation and feel excited to see this person in real life. ,
"You are not obligated to text the person you are seeing 24/7. It is okay to text simply to confirm logistics of planning a date. You should not be overthinking sending a text. If you do, then ask yourself how you feel about this person and if you are genuinely excited to see them in-person.  The goal is to have light-hearted, enjoyable conversations and keep getting to know them in person on the date itself",
"If you have a date planned for the weekend, you can continue the conversation through fun banter during the week. You can send something funny or cute to let them know you are thinking of them and are excited to see them. But you do not need to text them 24/7 in the time leading up to it. ",
"If you met someone via a dating app, you often times do not have much context about them except for what you see on their profile. In that case, do not force a dry generic conversation to pass time till your date which can in fact put you at a disadvantage. Don't send messages like ""what's up?"" or ""how's your day going? - instead just confirm date logistics, indicate your excitement. Get to know them ON the date, not before. ",
"If someone doesn't text when you are expecting them to, it's not the final event - it's a piece of data. Give them some time to text you, and note down how long they usually takes to respond. You can wait a day or two and then send a light-hearted feeler like ""Gentle Nudge :)""",
"If you have been texting someone consistently and it has been more than 48 hours since they last messaged you, it is likely they may not be interested. You want to invest time in people who consider you a priority. If they are genuinely interested in you and haven't texted saying that they are busy for the next few days, it shows that both of you have different communication expectations and it would best to discuss this with them. ",
You know you have been ghosted if you have messaged the person more than twice and they have not responded. Ask yourself if you want to invest your time in someone who does not message you back or is equally excited to see you - it is best to move on and focus on yourself. Invest time in people that invest effort and energy in you. ,
"If someone has ghosted you, resist the urge to reprimand them. It could feel satisfying in the moment, but it only makes you look bad. It is best to move on in this situation. ",
"Sometimes when someone chooses to ghost, they conclude that you couldn't take subtler hints that there wasn't a connection. Although, ghosting isn't the best option, trying to reach back out to them after you have realized they chose to end things doesn't make you look good. You can send a goodbye text if that feels natural and not too forced, but then you need to cut the cord. ",
The use of emojis in texting is a fun way to show off your personality and can add more meaning to your texts (e.g. help you communicate the tones such as sarcasm). Don't feel pressured to have to use emojis however - use them when they feel the most natural - use them deliberately. ,
"Use emojis in your texts when they help you communicate more effectively. As the saying goes, ""less is more"": sprinkle emojis here and there in your texting when it helps add more context. ",
"Dating apps are the new norm and a great way to meet a potential partner. Your photos hold far more value than information such as your personality, your education and career, to name a few as the photos are the first thing someone sees on the app. Photos are an opportunity for you to make a good first impression and important deciding factor in whether or not someone swipes right on you. ",
Photos are the most important factor in determining whether or not someone will swipe right on you on a dating app. You need to replace selfies with a high-quality image of yourself.,
The photos you use on a dating app play a major role in whether or not someone swipes right on you since it is usually the first impression they get of you.

You can use a group photo if you are certain that you look good in it and potentially far better looking than everyone else. The goal is for your to be the center of attention and not your friend. ,

"If you want to stand out from other people on dating apps, one thing you can do is be specific in your bio. If you like a specific kind of cuisine, then share details on how you discovered it and the particular dish you like. Presentation matters so how you choose to communicate your story will reflect your personality. ",
"If you want to stand out from other people on dating apps, one thing you can do is ""show and not tell"". It is far more effective for example illustrate your typical Sunday descriptively (e.g. where you go, what you do, who you spend time with) rather than being general. ",
"Laughter is key to breaking ice. As you build your dating app profile, sprinkle some humor into your bio and prompts (and even the images you use). You don't have to be a comedian, but you win if you can make the person laugh. ",
,
"Dating apps are a great way to meet someone new, but there's also a possibility of being catfished. As you build your dating app profile, using proof points (e.g. the little blue checkbox by your name, your job, education, age, links to your social media accounts, etc.) adds credibility to your profile, and removes the chances of your profile being perceived as fake. ",

,
Apps like hinge allow you to share information such as your drinking and smoking habits or your religious beliefs to name a few. It is best to leave them blank.

Remember that there is a difference between engaging in a thoughtful and respectful conversation where you share a difference of opinion versus treat someone disrespectfully for not feeling the same way. ,
"You do not need to over text someone before your first date. This can in fact text you out of the first date which you don't want to risk.

"If they call you endearing names like angel, sweetheart, or honey, yet assert they're not ready for a relationship, remember that a name is just a term of endearment.

Photos are the most important factor in determining whether or not someone will swipe right on you on a dating app. You need to replace selfies with a high-quality image of yourself.,

"You do not need to over text someone before your first date. This can in fact text you out of the first date which you don't want to risk.

"If you have already met in-person and are still in the early stages of getting to know this person, you can keep texting to a minimal and focus on ""getting to know them"" on the in-person date.

Start by finding similarities between both of you (e.g. ""I see we both are fans of Kendrick. Die Hard is a personal favorite - wbu?"") and be specific in your messaging (e.g. other topics you can cover are travel locations, food, and outfits, etc.).",

"Keep your first text on the dating app short and sweet - include a fun fact about you and connect it to them (e.g. ""your designer and i'm a filmmaker - seems like we'd make a good pair what do you think?"").",
"When sending your first follow-up message post your first date, try and allude a to an inside joke or something you both had a laugh over during your first date. Then suggest a second date. Ex. ""a little glitter for kendrick wouldn't hurt - have fun at the concert! i had a good time with you - would love to see you again""). Banter is a light-hearted way to continue the conversation. ",
,
"Match their energy - this is key especially in periods where you are waiting to see them in-person. Remember the ""get to know them"" part should take place on the in-person date rather than over text. You should text during this period if it feels natural - if they are asking you questions then respond and ask them questions in return so ""match their energy"" (ex. casual slow banter, asking questions, etc.).",
"If you've had a few dates and are trying to continue conversation with the person via text (aka the talking stage), topics that you touch on should be timely such as things that are happening presently in the their life, a conversation you had during your in-person date, etc. Do not ask a lot of get to know you questions - those are good for a date.",
"As you speak over text or chat in person you can be deliberate about certain things that can convey your interest to the other person (e.g. remembering small details about the person, giving them compliments, or sharing an activity you've done and are excited to try out with them, etc.).

Don't let someone show you more than once that they don't want you. ,
"If the person you are seeing shares with you that they are not interested or do not see this going anywhere, then you can acknowledge their message or respond with a ""good luck with everything"" (but do this only if it feels natural otherwise it's okay to like the message and cut the cord). ",
"If the person you are seeing says that now is probably not a good time to go out on dates (e.g. they may be consumed with other things in their life), then you can acknowledge that and let them know if you're interested in seeing them in the future once things clear up on their end. ",
"If someone keeps ignoring your invitations to go on a date, they are simply not interested in you. Don't waste your time - move on. ",
"If they cancel the date the day of without a reason, you can suggest rescheduling, but if they don't reciprocate that you can assume they aren't as interested. Leave it to them to reach out and move on if they don't. ",
"If you're excited to see someone but they cancel the date due to work, try to be flexible around their schedule. (eg ""up for a coworking session today instead?"" or ""happy to meet you where you are for a quick coffee break if you're up for it?""). If they don't reciprocate the same energy leave it at that. Don't push. ",
"If you are trying to shoot your shot with someone from the past you haven't dated, you can send them a text or slide up in their DMs about something they've been doing recently so it feels natural and not weird (e.g. ""Had no clue you're into pickleball as well - want to play sometime?"").",
"If you're reaching back out to someone from the past you haven't dated but want to see if they're open to going out with you, you can send a text like: ""hey! back in your city and would love to see you :)"" or if you want to be a little less straight forward and follow them on social media you can slide up in their DMs so it feels more timely (e.g. if they posted an image of them getting kulfi with friends for example you can say ""you know another place that has the best kulfi in the city is bungalow - want to grab dinner and drinks sometime?"")",

"It's fun to be expressive as you tell stories - it let's your personality shine through and adds an element of entertainment (e.g. if you ask them ""have you ever jumped a turnstile?"" and they respond with they don't know what that means you can show them by ""acting it out"").",
"If they ask you a question and you don't know the answer to it, then instead of saying you don't know play the guessing game and have fun with your guesses - it makes the conversation more entertaining (e.g. if they ask ""do you know what Kame is?"" and you don't know instead of saying ""i don't know"" you can guess: ""the...bar? a restaurant? park? how close am i?"").",
"One way you can show someone that you are interested in them is by remembering small details about them (e.g. ""a good friend of mine from college was also italian and loved doing donuts in the car too"") - it makes them feel special. ",
When you go on in-person dates be observant of their facial expressions. How do they respond to certain things you say? A good sign of attraction is if they mimic your behavior (eg. you take a sip of water and they do the same right after you).,
"Don't place an ultimatum 2 - 3 weeks into seeing each other (e.g. ""if you're not interested in a long-term relationship then we should go our separate ways""). If the first date was bad, you don't have to go on a second date and you know this isn't a match, but if you're interested in the person don't rush to solidify the relationship. Give it a month or two to test how you feel with this person - is there flow? do you like their friends? do you feel comfortable with them? are you having fun? Sometimes it can take a bit longer for the spark to come through, but if something absolutely goes wrong within the first few weeks that's a deal-breaker for you then it's safe to call it off. ",
Another way to tell if someone is interested in you is if they try to minimize the distance you and them (e.g. you're walking side by side and they walk pretty close to you instead of maintaining x FaceTime. of distance like a normal person).,
Never accept last minute dates. Your time is valuable and you are not someone's backup plan,
Fear of commitment boils down to asking yourself if you see yourself spending a lot of time with a specific person - do you think they are the one? If you aren't confident in your answer then it's best to continue exploring to learn more about yourself. ,
Ease your way into a relationship - don't rush it. Good vibes and chemistry are only a part of what makes a good relationship. It's important to share similar beliefs and values (e.g. do you share similar long-term goals? do you share similar spiritual beliefs?).,
You have to act like the prize to be treated like the prize. ,
