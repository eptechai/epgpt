### Input:\n
Question: What are the major operational and industry-specific risks for Coinbase?\n
Context: We identified several operational and industry-specific risks that Coinbase faces. Firstly, the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and any significant market fluctuations can adversely impact our business operations and financial condition. Secondly, our operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. Changes in these laws or regulations, or a failure by us to comply with them, could adversely affect our business. Thirdly, our business depends on the continued growth and adoption of digital assets, including Bitcoin. If such growth and adoption do not continue, it could negatively impact our business. Finally, our business is subject to operational risks including, but not limited to, system interruptions or failures, security breaches, or changes in the infrastructure of the internet. These risks could result in financial loss, loss of user confidence, and could negatively affect our brand and reputation. We also face competition from other companies providing similar services, which could lead to a loss of market share. Lastly, our business is heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure. Any disruptions, failures, or breaches of our technology or infrastructure could negatively impact our business operations and financial results.\n\n
### Output:\n
Coinbase faces major risks including market volatility in the cryptocurrency space, regulatory changes, and the growth of digital assets like Bitcoin. Operational risks such as system failures and security breaches, along with competition, also pose threats to the company.
